    kaupapa: `To create a project that utilizes the skills I've acquired throughout my journey with Three.js, incorporating custom 3D models I've designed using Blender.`,
    design: `This project began on paper where I sketched ideas of what I would like to build in Blender. I was drawn to Mid Century modern and Space Age design. My main source of inspiration for the models was the 60s Cartoon The Jetsons that captivated me as a child. Iâ€™ve enjoyed watching clips of the show during my investigation and noticing parallel technologies on the show and in my own life. We really do live in the future. `,
    p2: `The 3D models were crafted using Blender. Throughout the development process, I refined and modified the models to align with the desired user interactivity and overall experience. In particular, I would like to highlight the design journey of the initial 3D model. After careful consideration, I ultimately chose to incorporate a jukebox-inspired archway for two significant reasons. Firstly, this design has more of visual impact as the user navigates through the experience. Secondly, it showcases a nostalgic Jetsons-like aesthetic, aligning perfectly with my vision for the project's retro theme.`,
    p3: `

    While I utilised Blender to create the buildings and arches, I relied on Three.js Geometries for the scene, path, and game obstacles. The project consists of two main areas: a portfolio section at the beginning of the path and a marble game later on.`,
