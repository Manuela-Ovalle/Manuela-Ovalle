    kaupapa: `To create a project that utilizes the skills I've acquired throughout my journey with Three.js, incorporating custom 3D models I've designed using Blender.`,
    design: `This project began on paper where I sketched ideas of what I would like to build in Blender. I was drawn to Mid Century modern and Space Age design. My main source of inspiration for the models was the 60s Cartoon The Jetsons that captivated me as a child. Iâ€™ve enjoyed watching clips of the show during my investigation and noticing parallel technologies on the show and in my own life. We really do live in the future. `,
    p2: `The 3D models were crafted using Blender. Throughout the development process, I refined and modified the models to align with the desired user interactivity and overall experience. In particular, I would like to highlight the design journey of the initial 3D model. After careful consideration, I ultimately chose to incorporate a jukebox-inspired archway for two significant reasons. Firstly, this design has more of visual impact as the user navigates through the experience. Secondly, it showcases a nostalgic Jetsons-like aesthetic, aligning perfectly with my vision for the project's retro theme.`,
    p3: `While I utilised Blender to create the buildings and arches, I relied on Three.js Geometries for the scene, path, and game obstacles. The project consists of two main areas: a portfolio section at the beginning of the path and a marble game later on.`,

    design:
      'I worked with the Jeweller at Frankie Ruins to develop and idea that would suit the needs of his business. As Frankie Ruins offers bespoke and custom pieces, we opted to go for a more portfolio-styled site showcasing their previous projects rather than e-commerce store.',
    p2: `I wanted to give potential customers the engaging experience of holding a piece by Frankie ruins even virtually. That is what prompted me to have a model of the ring as the hero section of the site. Going forward, I would like to have several models for customers to switch between and move around within the hero section.`,
    p3: 'This project will be a full stack application using a database for the gallery portion of the site. Due to the nature of this project, Sebastian (The Jeweller) and I are designing an intermediary site design with only the 3D model and links to social media to have a project deployed as the full stack application is in development.',
